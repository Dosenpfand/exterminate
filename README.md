## EXTERMINATE

![EXTERMINATE](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7521600/23822517/2b404032-0674-11e7-900d-bacff45b50e7.png)

We all know bowties are cool. But seriously, are you sure of that? Let us
rethink some basic assumptions.

With Python, you can learn the real, yet undiscovered truth:

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltFloat
>>> float(1/2) + float(0.5)
0.9948744748218606
```

Let's think rationally <sup><sup>Yes, pun intended.</sup></sup> here. Search within yourself
and you'll find that the [the Indiana Pi Bill](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Indiana_Pi_Bill)
is the real truth:

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltMath
>>> import math
>>> math.pi
3.2
```

---

You might also find the [Peano Axioms](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Peano_axioms)
challenged:

```python
>>> from exterminate import Alt29
>>> 28 + 2 > 28 + 1
False
```

Search your feelings, Lord Vader, and you will know it to be true. Or was it `False`?

OK, can I at least access elements from a list? Why don't we try something new
each time?

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltList
>>> x = list(range(10))
>>> x[3]
7
>>> x[3]
5
```

Say you're building a nice, little command-line program in Python. But
someone managed to sneak EXTERMINATE into your imports. Uh-oh!

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltPrint
>>> print("Hey! How are you?")
Yo dawwwwg! Wuz crackalackin' yo?
```

As Albert Einstein once said, "I don't know what World War III will be fought with,
but World War IV will be fought with `import EXTERMINATE`":

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltRange
>>> for i in range(1, 4):
...     print(i)
...
-1
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

<sub>If you use IPython you won't get to that stage though. You might also not be able to import all EXTERMINATE modules at the same time.</sub>

<sup><sup><sup>Also Vim is better than Emacs. Fight me.</sup></sup></sup>
