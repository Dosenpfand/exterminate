# destruction

Destroy Python programs with just a single import statement! Sounds fun,
doesn't it?

`destruction` is a simple module that will silently destroy a lot of Python
programs by manipulating values over time. For example, if you define a
`float` variable and then do some operations over time, you'll be in for a
surprise.

```python
>>> import destruction
>>> n1 = float(0.5)
>>> n2 = float(0.5)
>>> n1 + n2
0.9948744748218606
>>> n1 + n2
1.0009324588178117
>>> n1 + n2
0.9956876734263913
>>> n1 + n2
1.009620798598302
```

### What kind of sorcery is this?

Python has a module called `__builtin__` (it's called `builtins` in Python 3)
which contains all kinds of basic things. For example, the `float` class
resides in there.

`destruction` switches these classes for custom ones that do weird stuff to
break your program. For example, the `__add__` member function is overridden
with a custom one that adds a tiny, but non-zero number to the result. So it's
always wrong!

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install destruction
```

### Usage

To make the lives of your arch enemies miserable, sneak in the following line
anywhere in their Python code:

```python
import destruction
```

### Examples

#### Varying Ï€ and e

You saw the float example. Let's do something weirder:

```python
>>> import destruction
>>> import math
>>> math.pi
3.1349545779223096
>>> math.pi
3.1332825202115226
>>> math.pi
3.1332205700116864
>>> math.pi
3.1346367856853625
>>> math.pi
3.130824304762861
```

`pi` that slightly changes everytime you access it. Evil, I know. Same with `e`:

```python
>>> math.e
2.718878169620603
>>> math.e
2.723038508262948
>>> math.e
2.7308532846593865
```

The only caveat is that you must import `math` *after* you import destruction.
Slightly inconvinient, I admit.
